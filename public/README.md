# Resume template

This is a template of my resume

## Docs

### Customizing

First you'll want to fork the repo to your own account. Then clone it locally and customize, or use the GitHub web editor to customize.

#### Options/configuration

Most of the basic customization will take place in the `/_config.yml` file and in files under _data directory

#### CI CD Pipeline
If you want to publish your resume to a location different from the original repository, implement a post-commit hook
that takes contents of the build and copies commits into a different repo. Here is how I did it
```
#!/bin/sh -xv
#.git/hooks/post-commit
source ~/.bashrc
cd ~/source/resume-template # This is the location of the editable version of your resume
gem install bundler -v 1.16.1
bundle exec jekyll build --destination ~/source/resume-template/public --trace
cd ~/source/imalinovsky.bitbucket.io  # This is a repo where I publish to. It will only publish the content of public
git pull
cp -r ~/source/resume-template/public/* .
git add .
git commit -am "This commit is generated by CI pipeline"
git push
```
