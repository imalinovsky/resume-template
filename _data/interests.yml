    I'm a pretty decent home chef, a guitar player and singer, listener of all kinds of music (ok, not all kinds, but a lot of them), a lover of dark humor and stand-up comedy. I've gotten into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBxTEoseZak">smoking meats</a> (I make a <i>mean</i> rack of <a href="https://jesspryles.com/recipe/smoked-bbq-beef-ribs/">beef ribs</a>).
