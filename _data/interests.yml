    A geek, a runner and an epicurean. Built HPC cluster for under $100 running off a cellphone charger that rivals
    a million of Apollo 13 Space Shuttle compute modules. Run 620 miles in 2018 and a bit more in 2019. Cherish a good conversation and an
    occasional Scotch. Speak natively more than two languages. Some with accent.
